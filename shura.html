          <p>Shura-i-Islam (from the arabic "Council of Islam" or "Islamic Council") is a socio-political organization in Turkestan that existed during the 1917 revolution and the Civil War in Russia. The organization was founded in early March 1917 in Tashkent and was ideologically connected with the national democratic educational movement of Jadidism.

          <h3>History of Shura-i-Islam</h3>
          <p>One of the main political demands of the organization was the creation of a national-religious autonomy for Turkestan within Russia. The organization advocated the preservation of private property, including land.

            On April 16-23, 1917, the Shura-i-Islam congress was held, which was attended by delegates from 42 of its branches. The congress made a decision on the cultural and political self-government of Turkestan and expressed confidence in the Provisional Government. The "Regional Council of Turkestan Muslims" was elected at the congress.
            
            Since the inception of the organization, two main wings of the Jadids and Ulemists have emerged. The former advocated the implementation of bourgeois democratic reforms, the latter were supporters of orthodox Islam, demanded observance of Sharia norms, opposed the educational reform in the European manner. In June 1917, the Ulemists withdrew from Shura-i-Islam and formed their own organization, Shura-i-Ulema.
            
            Members of the organization negatively greeted the October Revolution in Russia and the Armed Uprising in Tashkent in October 1917. In response to the proclamation of the Turkestan Soviet Republic in Tashkent, members of the organization took part in the creation of a national government in Kokand (see Turkestan Autonomy). After the defeat of the government in Kokand, members of the organization participated in the Basmachi movement against Soviet power in Turkestan.</p>

          <h3>Liquidation by USSR</h3>
          <p> In January 1918, in response to the ultimatum presented, Shokai refused to recognize the power of the Soviets.

            To liquidate the Turkestan autonomy, 11 echelons with troops and artillery under the command of Konstantin Osipov arrived in Tashkent from Moscow.
            
            
            Thus, the Turkestan autonomy was liquidated by the Bolsheviks and Dashnaks just 3 months after its creation.
            
            She was replaced by Soviet Turkestan.</p>
