          <h3>History of Communist party</h3>
          <p>Until 1921, there was no single party center of the Bolsheviks in Kazakhstan, but there was a base in the form of the Communist Party of Turkestan, created in June 1918, which included the party organizations of the Syrdarya, Semirechensk, parts of the Turgai and Ural regions. On April 30, 1920, the Central Committee of the RCP (b) created the Kyrgyz Regional Bureau of the RCP (b), which included A. Avdeev, A. Aitiev, A. Alibekov, S. Argancheev, A. Dzhangildin, M. Murzagaliev, S. Pestkovsky. From 11 to 18 June 1921, the 1st Kyrgyz regional party conference was held in Orenburg, which elected the regional party committee. In April 1922, the Kyrgyz Bureau of the Central Committee of the RCP (b) was created.

            Within the framework of the Lenin Call to the Party in 1924, about 8 thousand people were admitted to the party, including over 6 thousand workers and a significant number of farm laborers. According to the decision of the Central Committee of the RCP (b) of February 19, 1925, the regional committee was renamed into the regional committee. In connection with the creation of the Kazakh SSR in 1936, the Central Committee of the CPSU (b) on April 23, 1937 transformed the regional party organization into the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Kazakhstan. The 1st Congress of the Communists of the Republic in June 1937 completed the formation of the CP (b) K.</p>
